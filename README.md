# FastICA
Fast Independent Component Analysis code tailored for astrophysics application, namely CMB component separation.
There are several scientific papers describing FastICA application to CMB studies. You can read
  * All-sky astrophysical component separation with Fast Independent Component Analysis (FASTICA), 2002, MNRAS Volume 334, Issue 1, pp. 53-68
  * Astrophysical component separation of COBE-DMR 4-yr data with FastICA, 2003, MNRAS Volume 344, Issue 2, pp. 544-552
  * Separating polarized cosmological and galactic emissions for cosmic microwave background B-mode polarization experiments, 2006, MNRAS Volume 372, Issue 2, pp. 615-629
  * New insights into the foreground analysis of the WMAP 5-year data using FASTICA, 2010, MNRAS Volume 402, Issue 1, pp. 207-225

The code requires the following libraries to be installed:
  * HEALPix
